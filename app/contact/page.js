          This lady from a little town in central Italy told me I had a
          &#34;bad-eye&#34; over me, and made a ritual to make it go away. She
          used two dishes, some oil drops, and while she moved her hands she
          prayed, and repeatedly said something I couldn&rsquo;t understand. It
          was in an italian dialect. I was inspired by this episode to draw all
          the ingredients I saw that night and made some kind of tea towels that
          are also a spell. This is done to remember her, she died two months
          later.{" "}
